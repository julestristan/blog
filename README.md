# My Hugo-based blog.

I wanted to build a blog using Hugo to have a platform where I could express myself.  
I already went to the dev of a personal website using node.js through past projects and
being able to create with Hugo felt so convenient compared to what I experienced back then.

## Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a framework written in C that allows users to create a website very easily.  
It is free to use and it offers a wide range of theme presets made by the community.

## Content of the website

I will mainly post about my current hobbies and what I am currently interested in.   
You can expect all sort of posts, from travel review to tech.

Thank you for reading this and have a good day :]
